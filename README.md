# Viewing stock price graphs

These should be visible via the browser from the [stock_histories notebook](https://github.com/Arepo/clintrial_prediction/blob/main/stock_histories.ipynb) (they start about halfway down the page). 

Alternatively, you should be able to run the notebook yourself if you have Jupyter Notebook installed. In theory the [trial_data notebook](https://github.com/Arepo/clintrial_prediction/blob/main/trial_data.ipynb) generates the results list on which the stock histories notebook relies, but for now I've just pasted the outcome of running it into a variable at the top of the latter, so you should be able to run either of them independently.
